    <h2>What is crypto trading</h2>
    <p class="para">Crypto trading is the act of buying and selling digital assets, like Bitcoin or 
	Ethereum, on an exchange to profit from price fluctuations. Traders purchase a 
	cryptocurrency when they believe its value will rise and sell it later for a profit, 
	or they can speculate on a price decrease.</p>
